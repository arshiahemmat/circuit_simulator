# circuit_simulator
This project examines the analysis of an electrical circuit including resistors and draws a current-voltage diagram for them
The program is in both English and Persian and is graphic
With the help of Lieb mataplot, we can draw voltage current diagrams for each resistor.
Steps of working with the simulator:
  Specify the amount of current and voltage
  
  Specify voltage and current source values 
  
  Specify series resistors
  
  Specify parallel resistors
  
  Circuit analysis by equivalent resistance
  
  Draw a current voltage diagram
